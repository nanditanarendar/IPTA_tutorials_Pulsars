    "# Timing pulsars:\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is adapted from existing NANOGrav Timing Tutorials created by Sofia Sosa and Michael Lam. \n",
    "\n",
    "## An introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can do precision pulsar timing array science, we have to develop an initial timing solution. In fact, the 0th step in this process is to search for pulsars. But in the interest of time, we will assume that has already been done for us.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When a new pulsar is discovered in a pulsar search, we generally have minimal information about it -- just its general posiion on the sky, its spin period, and its dispersion measure. \n",
    "\n",
    "All of the rest of the pulsar details we'll find by \"solving\" the pulsar. This is an iterative process that continues at some level forever, as we get more observations of the pulsar and refine our timing solution. But, the initial pulsar solving proces is perhaps the most satisfying activity in pulsar astronomy, so we'll focus in on it. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, our actual PTA pulsars tend to be a bit complicated, so we will start with solving a fake pulsar then move on to refining a timing solution for a real PTA pulsar. \n",
    "\n",
    "# What is pulsar timing? \n",
    "Pulsar timing precisely predicts when pulses from a pulsar will arrive at our telescope. We define a \"timing model\" that includes spin parameters of the pulsar (how the pulsar spins), astrometric parameters of the pulsar (how the pulsar moves across the sky), binary parameters (where applicable -- how the pulsar orbits its companion), and how the interstellar medium affects the pulse as it propagates from the pulsar to Earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cartoon below attempts to illustrated all of these features: pulsar spin, binary motion, motion throughout the galaxy of the pulsar, motion of Earth around the Sun and through the galaxy, and the interstellar medium. The relative motion of the Earth and the pulsar is illustrated with the big black arrows. The two different colored (red and blue) curves demonstrate the effects of the interstellar medium: a single broadband pulse then spreads out in frequencies due to dispersion, such that longer wavelengths (red) arrive later than shorter wavelengths (blue).\n",
    "\n",
    "![timing model](images/timing.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If our timing model isn't accurate, we won't be able to predict the arrival of pulses. This is illustrated in the figure below. A good model (like the top panel) predicts the pulse arrival times exactly, while a bad model (like the middle panel) will not. Our mission is to improve our timing model, by adding and modifying parameters until our predictions match the more complex physical reality of the pulsar (as in the bottom panel). \n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between the observed time of arrival (TOA) of a pulse and the predicted arrival time is known as a timing residual, and plots of residuals help us visualize whether or not we have a good model or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "![pulse train](images/pulse_train3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will develop an initial pulsar timing solution, and along the way discover how incorrect or missing parameters change the shape of your residual plot. This exercise is written in PINT, but the same techniques can be used in TEMPO2 or TEMPO -- it's just a matter of using the right syntax. We've chosen to present the PINT process to keep the tutorials consistently in a Python framework, but depending on what PTA you're working with and your goal, TEMPO2 may be more appropriate in the long-run.\n"

    "# What information do we have about a newly discovered pulsar?\n",
    "\n",
    "When we first discover a pulsar, we only have a few pieces of information about it (the spin period, the DM, and the position). This is enough information to observe the pulsar reliably, but it's not enough fit parameters to adequately predict times of arrival. We use this very basic set of information to observe the pulsar enought to fit other parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have just discovered a pulsar, J1910-3020, with a spin period of $P = 15 ms$. This is not a real pulsar -- this is a simple simulated pulsar designed to help us learn the process of timing pulsars. But, today, we're going to practice fitting it like it's real new pulsar. \n",
    "\n",
    "The activity below is not an exact analogy to this process -- it's very oversimplified because we're generating simulated TOAs as we go along. However, solving a real pulsar is similar process (and could very easily eat an entire week). "
